PREREQUISITES: 
Basics really. A working shell, a working PERL, a few common unix utilities (wget, xwd, fmt, shuf, tail) all of which should be pretty standard. Fortune and cowsay are the only non-standard tools. Both should be available via rpmforge, or the epel extras, or any of a number of places. Fortune's been around long enough to get a dinner discount at Denny's. Cowsay has been out there since at least 1999. I can't lay my hands on the source right now, but it is out there.  (I built this on Centos/SL, but it should run anywhere.)

INSTALLATION and USAGE:
1. Unpack the files into the directory of your choosing:
tar -xfvz {filename.tgz}

2. Edit the main script file (of_motd_update.sh) and update the user-specific variables to match your site. Note that if you're using HTTP (not preferred, since we pass the UserID and Password in the URL) you'll want to point to port 9090. If the server has a verified certificate you can change the IGNORETLS flag to "0" for fully operable TLS/HTTPS connectivity.

3. Verify that you can execute the script (chmod +x of_motd_update.sh)

4. Execute the script! (./of_motd_update.sh)

You may want to run the script via the cron scheduler. I just dropped it into my /etc/cron.hourly directory and let it go.

I've only tested it on a Scientific Linux (Centos/Fedora/RedHat) 6.7 system, but I can't see any reason it won't run just fine on any machine with fortune. You'll need cowsay for the whole package, but it'll run just fine without it.

I know it's not much of an install document, and I'll update it at some point. This should be enough to get you started anyway!
